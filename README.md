# Heart-Failure-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project leverages the power of machine learning to predict **heart failure** based on a range of clinical parameters. With cardiovascular diseases being the **leading cause of death globally**, this model aims to provide early insights into heart disease risk, enabling timely diagnosis and intervention.
